		<p>Originally from the DC area, I am a senior in the College of Engineering at the University of Notre Dame. I am pursuing a major in Computer Science with a minor in Engineering Corporate Practice, which allows me to balance my technical courses with some business-focused curriculum. Some of my favorite courses include Programming Paradigms, Case Studies in Computing-Based Entrepreneurship, and Paradoxes (taken to fulfill a philosophy requirement). I have greatly enjoyed the problem-solving nature of the courses within my major. This type of learning has also allowed me to collaborate with peers in many group project settings, learning from them and incorporating differing perspectives into our final products.</p>

		<p>Outside of my classes at Notre Dame, I have been very involved in College Mentors for Kids, a club that allows ND students to mentor elementary school students in the South Bend area. After previously serving as a mentor and Activity Director, I now manage all activity development as the Vice President of Activity planning. Working with children has always been a passion of mine, and I appreciate the opportunity to help them develop long-term learning goals.</p>

		<p>The summer following my freshman year, I had the opportunity to travel to Ireland with Notre Dame and participate in a 10 day immersive exploration of Irish business and culture. We traveled from Dublin to Belfast to Galway (pictured left), taking in much of the Irish countryside and cities. </p>
		<p>In line with Notre Dame's emphasis on dorm community, I lived in McGlinn Hall for my first three years at the University. During this time, I served as the dorm's PR/social media commissioner, developing and executing posters for McGlinn's philanthropic events, as well as creating content for the community's public social media accounts.</p>
